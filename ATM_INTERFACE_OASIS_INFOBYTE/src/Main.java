/* - ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is a network protocol designed to facilitate the simultaneous handling
of various types of traffic streams at very high speeds over the same physical connection.
- The interface between ATM switches is called a Network to Network Interface (NNI).

- To organize code I have created separate class also To maintain hierarchy and To provide template
for creating object In ATM_INTERFACE

- The classes are i)ATM.java ii)Bank_account.java iii)CheckBalance_Of_Acc.java iv)Transaction_Through_Atm.java
                  v)History_Of_Acc.java
